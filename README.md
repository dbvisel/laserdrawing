This code is for an Arduino connected to two servos and a laser pointer. This code needs a lot of work!

# HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

 * The servo controlling vertical motion should be controlled by pin 9 (_servo1Pin_).
 * The servo controlling horizontal motion should be controlled by pin 10 (_servo2Pin_).
 * The laser should be connected to pin 2 (_laserpin_).

 # TO DO

  * General routines for drawing lines + curves
  * Special routines for drawing letters
  * Code to process text
