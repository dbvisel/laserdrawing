This code is for an Arduino connected to two servos and a laser pointer.

 * The servo controlling vertical motion should be controlled by pin 9 (_servo1Pin_).
 * The servo controlling horizontal motion should be controlled by pin 10 (_servo2Pin_).
 * The laser should be connected to pin 2 (_laserpin_).

 This code needs a lot of work!
